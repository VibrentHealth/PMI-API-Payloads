# PMI-PPI

This repository hosts versioned payloads for the Precision Medicine Initiative "All of Us" Cohort program.

It contains:
- Document files provided by the PPI workgroup
- Current versions of questionnaire responses
- Prototyped versions of base definitions of Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse FHIR payloads

On each commit, validation tests runs in Circle CI to compare the Questionnaire payloads with the currently published code book content.
